# Notebook
 Small university project on choosing packing foam for specific senarios based on self aquired data.
 All data was aquired through compression testing using an instron universal testing system.
 The self defined performance of the packing material was defined as the energy absorbed per unit volume up to a maxiumum allowable stress, set by the object being packed.
 The summary of findings, has this notebook plot this performance against maxiumum allowable stress, theoretically allowing for the optimum packing foam to be selected.
 The optimum packing foam is defined as the one which requires the least thickness to protect the object.
